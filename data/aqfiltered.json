Specifically, I was thinking about creating a more general resizable_list struct that would contain an array of void pointers, rather than specific vector pointers, for example.\n\nThe part I was debating was whether I should then (1) still implement vec_list/star_list structs which have methods that simply call the more general methods implemented for the resizable_list, or (2) just use the resizable_list directly with either vector/star objects. \n\nIt seems like the first method is better in terms of abstracting away the type casting that would have to be done when actually using the lists, but the second method avoids having to write two more structs and a lot of methods for them which would mostly just be one line that calls the base resizable_list method. \n\nSorry this was kind of long, but I was wondering if I could get some help assessing which implementation to go with, or if there is anything I'm missing and should consider something different altogether.

Specifically, I was thinking about creating a more general resizable_list struct that would contain an array of void pointers, rather than specific vector pointers, for example.\n\nThe part I was debating was whether I should then (1) still implement vec_list/star_list structs which have methods that simply call the more general methods implemented for the resizable_list, or (2) just use the resizable_list directly with either vector/star objects. \n\nIt seems like the first method might make things simpler in terms of implementing things for the demo, but a lot of methods for the vec_list/star_list structs will just be one line that calls the base resizeable_list method.  While the second method avoids this drawback, I think there would be a lot of type casting that would have to be done when actually using the list. \n\nSorry this is kind of long, but I was wondering if I could get some help assessing which implementation to go with, or if there is anything I'm missing and should consider something different altogether.
